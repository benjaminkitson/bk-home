Welcome to my dev portfolio site! Built with Next.JS and hosted on AWS Amplify, the site is both intended to showcase some of the bits and pieces I've made, while also be a playground of sorts for me to independently build out a larger-scale Next.JS application. It uses a slightly janky approximation of CI/CD, in that whenever I make changes, tests run on my local machine before every push - on successful push, the app is then deployed to Amplify.

It's perpetually WIP, and I'm not really a UI designer, so on the off chance you're reading this with a view to potentially employing me to write code, please keep that in mind!

The ultimate goal is for each project to be a page within the application.
